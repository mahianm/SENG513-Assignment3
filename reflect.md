JavaScript Learning Curve:
•	My understanding of JavaScript expanded significantly, focusing more on user interactions and real-time feedback rather than page-to-page data manipulation.
•	Specifically I delved more into event handling, DOM manipulation, and translating user actions into game mechanics which was a pivotal learning point.
Initial Implementation Challenges:
•	Starting the implementation posed a significant challenge as there was no clear step-by-step guide or tutorial that I could jump from
•	It felt like beginning a game without a rulebook especially when initiating basic functionalities like player and puck movement.
•	I found it hard bridging the gap between user interactions in the HTML interface and the underlying JavaScript logic for aspects like player movement or puck controls
•	When I started implementing the core algorithms it demanded a deep understanding of physics principles within the game context. It was hard to accurately dictate the pucks behavior, including velocity adjustments, angle calculations upon collision, and smooth interactions with player elements.
Complexity Management Strategy:
•	I tried to slow down the process by creating a mental roadmap which prioritizes functionalities based on their dependencies allowing for a smoother start.
•	Once I was able to start visualizing components on the screen not just as abstract functions really helped streamline debugging and fine-tuning which made the project more manageable.
•	I started by addressing dependencies and starting with foundational elements. I was able to gradually build upon the core functionalities which made for a smoother and more manageable progression throughout the development phase. This approach helped me in laying a solid foundation before tackling more intricate aspects of the game.
Evolution of the Project:
•	I found that implementing fundamental features such as player movement and puck controls in steps acted as foundational building blocks which significantly expedited the progress of the project.
•	Each implemented element felt like solving a puzzle. It offered me clarity and significantly sped up the overall development process. This iterative approach allowed me to progressively construct the game mechanics paving the way for a more efficient and structured development path.
Comparison with Initial Design:
•	While the final product aligned well with the initial vision, improvements are still needed, especially in emulating realistic mallet and puck interactions.
Role of ChatGPT:
•	I utilized ChatGPT for debugging insights, receiving suggestions on debugging techniques and optimizing critical values like angles, velocity, and positions.
•	Leveraged ChatGPT as a quick reference for JavaScript documentation which helped me save time and streamlined implementation by obtaining relevant and concise code snippets.
•	I used ChatGPT for collaborative problem-solving where I looked for insights not just for debugging but also engaged in brainstorming sessions. This approach helped me explore more innovative solutions like addressing challenges with mallet and puck interactions which helped enhance critical aspects of the game mechanics.
Insights Gained from ChatGPT:
1.	Trigonometry Application in Collision Handling:
o	Insight: ChatGPT assisted me by explaining the trigonometric principles in calculating their practical application in game development.
o	Example from ChatGPT Assistance: I got a lot of guidance on collision handling where I received explanations on calculating angles and preserving speed during collisions. ChatGPT was able to explain the significance of trigonometry in functions like handlePlayerCollision for determining puck direction after collisions.
2.	Game Pacing and Speed Adjustments:
o	Insight:  ChatGPT assisted me by explaining the concept of dynamic game pacing and gradual speed increments for an engaging user experience.
o	Example from ChatGPT Assistance: I had discussed with ChatGPT on improving the game dynamics which helped me understand the importance of gradual puck speed increments within the movePuck function. ChatGPT highlighted the significance of adjusting speed dynamically to enhance gameplay excitement.
