Title: Air Hockey Game 

Target Platform: With my initial designs for the game, I have created a design for both the desktop and mobile view. When using the desktop platform, users can either use the W, A, S, D keys 
or arrow keys to control the mallets depending on which player they are. However, with my current experience level I am not totally confident I can implement the game with a touch based input.
Therefore, my focus is currently on desktop playability and I will explore touchscreen based gameplay for both players depending on the progress of the assignment. 

Game Genre: This implementation of the air hockey game is a mix of the “Sports” and “Arcade” genres. In the realm of “Sports”, it compares to the competitive and skill oriented nature of real
sports which bears a particularly close connection to the game of ice hockey due to its similar layout and gameplay. Simultaneously, in the “Arcade” genre, it embraces the retro design paired
with its rapid paced action and the pursuit of high scores which mirror the engaging nature of classical arcade games. 

Game's Objective: In my implementation of the air hockey game, the primary goal for the player is to accumulate a predetermined point total before their opponent does. The first person that 
can reach this specific point goal will win the game. To advance in the game, a player must strive to shoot the puck into their opponent's goal while at the same time trying their best to 
guard their own net. 

Rules of the Game:
•	Players control mallets on opposite sides of the air hockey table.
•	The puck is placed in the center of the table at the start and after each goal is scored.
•	Players use their mallets to hit the puck into the opponent's goal to score points.
•	The first player to reach the designated point goal (e.g., 10 points) wins.
•	The puck must not enter your own goal otherwise a point is awarded to your opponent.
•	Players should not cross the centerline when striking the puck (implemented by a predefined space where the user can only move their mallet).

Game Mechanics:
•	Players control their mallet's movement using keyboard keys (e.g., Player 1 uses "W," "A," "S," and "D," while Player 2 uses arrow keys).
•	The mallets move within their respective halves of the table to hit the puck.
•	Players need to aim and time their mallet strikes to hit the puck into their opponent's goal while defending their own goal.
•	Scoring points involves getting the puck into the opponent's goal.
•	The game tracks each player's score and the first player to reach the set number of points wins.
•	The game provides feedback to players such as displaying the winner and offering a restart option.
